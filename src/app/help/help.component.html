Instructions for the "Scrambled Words" Game:
Objective: The goal of the game is to complete as many words as possible correctly and learn about the structure of the language while playing.
How to Play:
At the beginning of each round, you'll be asked to choose a word category to play with.
A series of jumbled letters will then be presented to you.
Your task is to arrange the scrambled letters in the correct order to form a valid and logical word.
Once you've arranged the letters, click on the "Submit" button to check if the word you created is correct.
After clicking "Submit," the system will check your arrangement and provide feedback.
You will then move on to the next word, and so on, until you complete all the words in the chosen category.
During the game, you can track your progress using a progress bar.
At the end of the round, after you've gone through all the words in the category, your final score will be displayed.
Instructions for the "Word Sorting" Game:
Objective: The goal is to sort the words that appear on the screen into the correct categories.
How to Play:
At the beginning of each round, a list of categories will be presented for you to choose from.
Select the category you wish to play with.
After selecting a category, the system will randomly choose another category and mix 3 words from each category.
In each round, an English word will be displayed along with a question asking whether the word belongs to the chosen category.
After selecting your answer, the system will check your response and provide feedback.
After receiving the feedback, you will move on to the next word.
After sorting all six words, your final score will be displayed.
